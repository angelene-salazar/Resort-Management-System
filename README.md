The Resort Management System (RMS) is a GUI‑based application built using Python and CustomTkinter. Unlike basic reservation tools, this RMS supports real‑timetable and room availability, automated fee computation, multi‑facility booking, user account management, and automatic handling of overnight checkouts at 8:00 AM. All records are stored securely in an SQLite database with structured tables for bookings, rooms, tables, and users.
